<h1> Chapter 8 vs Chapter 7  </h1>
  <p> In chapter 8, we see how the change in data can be better displayed. The previous data discussed mean, mode, median, and range. It showed perspective models, like histograms, that would represent the data as well. Chapter 8 discusses more charts that show the change between points and how the relationship represents different things based on whats being displayed. The data in chapter 8 is continuous, and in chapter 7 it is not because we are dealing with a finite answer. </p>
  <h1> pros of visualization techniques of chapter 8 </h1>
  <ul>
    <li> We can see immediate trends in the data.</li>
    <li>We can see fluctuations during different seasons in the data.</li>
    <li> We can get a better representation of the data as a new point is presented or the data is changed or altered. </li>
  </ul>
  <h1>  cons of visualization techniques of chapter 8 </h1>
  <ul>
    <li> The data can be skewed due to the way the data is being displayed. </li>
    <li> Logarithmic are hard to rely on because they stay at a constant for majority of the graph, then they spike.<li>
   <li> Time series charts show a deceptive visualization, where the needed information for the graph to be interpretated is not shown. <li>
  </ul>
